	<br>
	<h2>Game Description: </h2>
	<p>In this game, you play as Isaac. A child who went into his basement escaping from his mother.<br> Isaac found lots of monsters that wanted to kill him, so he fought back.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Game Instructions: </h2>
	<p>You can move around the map with each <b>ARROW</b> key. <br> You shoot normal bullets with <b>SPACE</b> and a special blast with <b>M</b> key.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Technical Specifications: </h2>
	<p>Many features of this game depends on the FPS you got in the PC you are playing on. Fire rate or background and enemies velocity may be affected because of that.<br> You can't spam SPACE to shoot bullets faster, so you might have to time your shots. <br>The special blast is a powerful attack that is only available every 5 kills you earn. It's not stackable, so you will have to manage when to use it.<br> You will notice that enemies and background will go faster every wave. But that's not all. <br>Be careful because the higher your score is, there's a higher chance that enemies spawn with more life and shoot more often.<br> If you get past 5000 score, you will fight a final boss. </p>
	<br>
	<h2>Special Features: </h2>
	<p>There are 3 types of enemies (and a final boss), each type has it's own speed and sounds. There's a chance that an enemy randomly speeds up for a while.<br>You can notice a little animation on every character. There are different sounds for the same thing, so one time you might hear a sound and next time another sound.<br>The final boss has a random patron, so every time he moves is unpredictable. He shoots randomly and every 2 seconds.<br>The menu scene is the same if you die, if you play for the first time or if you win, but ir shows different things.</p>
